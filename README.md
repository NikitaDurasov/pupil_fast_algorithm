# Algorithm for determining pupil and iris boundaries

The project is dedicated to the creation and optimization of the algorithm for the rapid detection of the pupil in the user's photo.
The work is based on the publication

http://svn.code.sf.net/p/mlalgorithms/code/Group374/Chigrinskiy2016DeterminingIrisBoundaries/doc/Chigrinskiy2016DeterminingIrisBoundariesRus.pdf?format=raw

In the work it is planned to increase the accuracy achieved in the work presented above by more precise selection of the parameters and writing some components in C ++ and Java.
